Team Name: Phreekz
Group Members: Gordon Pan

Project Description:
We are creating a social music tracker website where users can track what they are listening to and display their top songs, top artists, minutes listened weekly and more. This website will also have a social aspect where users can add friends and see their friends profiles and can see what they like to listen to.
